  <a>Korean Fried Chicken</a>

  <p>
      <strong>Ingredients</strong><br>
      <strong>Marinade:</strong>
  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
      <li>½ yellow onion, grated</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

   <p>
      <strong>Other:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Batter:</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>¾ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed </li>
      </ul>

     <strong>Directions</strong><br>
     <strong>Step 1</strong><br>
     Gather all ingredients. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 2</strong><br>
      Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated.<br>
      Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 3</strong><br>
      Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 4</strong><br>
      While oil is heating, make the batter: Whisk cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt together in a large bowl.<br>
      Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles a smooth batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5</strong><br>
      Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 6</strong><br>
      Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 7</strong><br>
      Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Step 8</strong><br>
      Enjoy! :3
